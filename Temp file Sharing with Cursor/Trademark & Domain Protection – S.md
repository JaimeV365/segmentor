### One-sentence summary for each scenario

- **UK trademark alone** → You own the UK + you control the .com (and all global/generic domains) from anyone on the planet.  
- **Add EUTM** → You also own the entire EU-27 and control all European national domains and businesses.  
- **USA, India, Nigeria, China, etc.** → You have no direct rights there until you extend the protection (Madrid Protocol or local filing) when you actually have customers/revenue there.

Your £270 UK filing today already gives you 95 % of the real-world protection you need in year 1–2.  
Everything else is a cheap “when-you-need-it” upgrade.
