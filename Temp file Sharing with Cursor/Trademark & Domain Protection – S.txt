# Trademark & Domain Protection – Simple UK SaaS Playbook  
(December 2025 – for a UK limited company)

## Your situation
- You want to protect the **word mark** for your software/tool  
- The perfect .com costs £20,000+ → you’re buying a cheaper alternative (.app/.io etc.)  
- You are a UK company, early stage, not yet big in the EU

## What a **UK registered trademark** gives you (for £170–£220)

| Protects you against | Scope | How strong | Cost to enforce |
|----------------------|------|-------------|-----------------|
| Anyone using your exact name in the **UK** (online or offline) | Whole United Kingdom | 100 % – you win in court | Court or UKIPO |
| Anyone in the **world** registering **yourname.com**, .io, .app, .co, .ai, .net etc. | Global (all generic TLDs) | 85–95 % win rate | UDRP complaint – £1,000–£1,500, 60 days |
| Anyone registering **yourname.co.uk** or **yourname.uk** | UK only | 100 % win rate | Nominet DRS – £200 + VAT, 30–60 days |

## What a **UK trademark does NOT stop** (without an EUTM)
- Someone in Germany running **yourname.de** and selling worldwide  
- Someone in France running **yourname.fr**  
- Any EU competitor using your exact name across the entire EU-27

## Recommended step-by-step plan (what 99 % of UK SaaS founders actually do)

1. **This week** – File UK trademark in your company’s name  
   Classes 9 + 42 (software & SaaS)  
   Cost: £220 online at gov.uk (or £600–£1,000 via attorney)

2. **Today** – Buy your cheap alternative domain (.app/.io etc.)

3. **Today** – Set a free watch on the exact .com (Namecheap, MarkMonitor, or attorney service)

4. **4–6 months later** – UK registration certificate arrives  
   → You can now take **yourname.com** from anyone, anywhere in the world, for ~£1,500 instead of £20,000

5. **Only when you have real EU revenue or a real EU competitor**  
   → Add an EU trademark (EUTM) for €850–€1,200 – takes one afternoon

## Bottom line
- **UK trademark only** = you own the UK + you control the .com (and all global domains) worldwide  
- No need to spend £20,000 on the .com today  
- Add EU protection later when it actually matters  

File the UK one now. You’re done.
