# Watermark Controls Testing Instructions

Please follow these steps and copy the console output:

1. Open the browser console (F12)
2. Make sure you're in Premium mode (crown icon in top-right)
3. Click on "Watermark Controls" button
4. Try to change the logo dropdown to "Teresa Monroe"
5. Copy all console logs that start with "🔍"
6. Paste them in a new file called "watermark-debug-output.log"

We need to see:
- What effects are received by WatermarkPanel
- What effects are sent when you change the dropdown
- Whether App.tsx receives the updated effects
