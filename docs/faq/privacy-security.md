# Privacy & Security FAQ

## Is my customers' data safe?
**Keywords:** data safe, data security, privacy protection, customer data safe

Yes, absolutely. Your data never leaves your device. Segmentor.app runs entirely in your browser using local processing—we never see, store, or transmit your customer data anywhere.

Think of it like using a calculator: the numbers you enter stay on your device. We don't have servers collecting your information because there's nothing to collect. Your customer data remains 100% private and under your control.

**Key security features:**

- ✅ Zero cloud storage—all processing happens locally
- ✅ No data transmission to external servers
- ✅ Your files stay on your computer
- ✅ You can work offline once the page loads

When you export your analysis as a .seg file or PDF report, those files are created directly on your device and saved to your chosen location.

## Do you use cookies?
**Keywords:** cookies, tracking, analytics

No, we don't use cookies. Segmentor.app doesn't track you, create user profiles, or store any browsing data.

We respect your privacy by design. Since the tool runs entirely in your browser without requiring accounts or logins, there's no need for cookies. We don't collect analytics, track your behaviour, or sell your information to third parties.

The only data stored is what you choose to save locally using your browser's temporary storage (which you can clear anytime) or by exporting .seg project files.

**What this means for you:**

- No cookie consent banners
- No tracking across websites
- No targeted advertising
- No hidden data collection

## Where is my data stored?
**Keywords:** where data stored, data location, data storage

Only on your device. Your customer data is stored in two ways, both completely under your control:

**1. Browser temporary storage (automatic):**
When you're working on a segmentation, your data is temporarily held in your browser's memory. This allows you to refresh the page without losing work during your session. You can clear this anytime through your browser settings.

**2. .seg project files (manual):**
Use the Save button to export your complete project as a .seg file to your computer. This file contains your data, settings, and customisations. You choose where to store it (your computer, cloud storage, USB drive, etc.)—it's just a regular file you control.

We literally cannot access your data because it never reaches our servers. It's technically impossible for us to see it, which is exactly how it should be.

## Can I trust Segmentor with sensitive customer data?
**Keywords:** trust sensitive data, GDPR, enterprise security

Yes, because we never see it. This isn't just a privacy promise—it's how the technology works.

Segmentor.app uses a privacy-by-design architecture. All calculations happen in your browser using JavaScript, similar to how a spreadsheet works. When you upload a CSV file, it's processed entirely on your device without any upload to external servers.

**Why this matters for sensitive data:**

- ✅ GDPR compliant by design
- ✅ No data breach risk from our side
- ✅ Meets strict enterprise security requirements
- ✅ Safe for PII (personally identifiable information)
- ✅ No third-party data processors

You can even disconnect from the internet after loading the page and continue working—proof that nothing is being sent anywhere.

## Does the tool work offline?
**Keywords:** offline mode, work without internet, no connection

Yes! Once the page has loaded, you can work completely offline. All processing happens in your browser, so no internet connection is required after the initial page load.

This is possible because your data never needs to be sent to a server—everything runs locally on your device.

## Will my data be deleted if I don't use the tool for a while?
**Keywords:** data deletion, storage expiry, data retention

Your data stored in browser temporary storage may be cleared by your browser's storage management, but any .seg project files you've saved are permanent files on your computer. They won't be deleted unless you delete them yourself.

We recommend saving your work regularly as .seg files for long-term storage.
