# Using the Tool FAQ

## Can I filter or exclude certain customers?
**Keywords:** filter customers, exclude customers, hide customers

Yes! The tool offers several filtering options:

- **Date filters:** Analyse specific time periods with presets or custom ranges
- **Attribute filters:** Filter by country, language, or any custom attributes in your data
- **Score filters:** Filter by satisfaction or loyalty values
- **Exclude customers:** Temporarily hide specific customers from analysis

Use the filter panel to combine multiple filters and narrow down your analysis to specific customer segments.

## Can I adjust the quadrant boundaries?
**Keywords:** adjust midpoint, move quadrants, reposition centre

Yes! You can drag the midpoint (centre point) to reposition where the quadrants divide. This is useful when your data distribution suggests different thresholds would be more meaningful.

You can also resize the Apostles and Terrorists zones using the resize handles in the top-right and bottom-left corners of the chart.

## Can I manually reassign customers to different quadrants?
**Keywords:** manual reassignment, change quadrant, override classification

Yes, for points on quadrant boundaries. Click any data point to see its details. If the point sits on a boundary line, you'll see reassignment buttons to move it to an adjacent quadrant.

Manual reassignments are automatically cleared if you move the midpoint and the point is no longer on a boundary.

## What chart display options are available?
**Keywords:** chart controls, visualisation settings, display options

The chart controls let you:

- Toggle between Classic (Apostles/Terrorists) and Modern (Advocates/Trolls) terminology
- Show or hide Near-Apostles zones
- Control label visibility (all, quadrants only, or none)
- Toggle grid lines and scale numbers
- Show or hide axis legends

## Can I edit, delete, or hide customer entries?
**Keywords:** edit data, modify entries, update customer, hide entries

Yes. In the data table:

- Click the edit icon to modify satisfaction or loyalty scores
- Click the delete icon to remove individual entries, or use "Delete All Rows" to clear everything
- Click the hide/exclude icon to temporarily hide entries from analysis without deleting them—they'll remain in your data but won't appear in calculations or charts

## How do I see details about a specific customer?
**Keywords:** view details, customer information, data table

In the data table, click the details icon (eye or info icon) next to any customer entry to see all their information including name, email, satisfaction and loyalty scores, quadrant assignment, date, and any additional attributes you've uploaded.

## Does the tool work with different satisfaction scales?
**Keywords:** scale detection, automatic normalisation, different scales, satisfaction scale

Yes. The tool automatically detects and normalises 1-3, 1-5, and 1-7 satisfaction scales. You can mix different scales in the same dataset—the tool will handle the conversion automatically.

## Does the tool work with different loyalty scales?
**Keywords:** loyalty scale, different loyalty scales, automatic detection

Yes. The tool automatically detects and normalises 1-5, 1-7, 1-10, and 0-10 loyalty scales. Your satisfaction and loyalty scales can be different—the tool handles each independently.

## How does the tool handle overlapping data points?
**Keywords:** frequency clustering, overlapping points, multiple responses

When multiple customers share the same satisfaction and loyalty scores, they're displayed as a single point with a frequency indicator. Click the point to see all customers at that position and their details.

## What happens if I move the midpoint after making manual reassignments?
**Keywords:** midpoint change, manual reassignment, auto clear

If you move the midpoint and a manually reassigned point is no longer on a boundary, the manual reassignment is automatically cleared. The point reverts to its natural classification based on the new midpoint position.

## Can I undo changes I've made?
**Keywords:** undo, revert changes, reset

You can reload your saved project file to restore previous settings. The tool doesn't have an in-session undo feature, so it's recommended to save your work regularly using the Save button.

## How do I reset the chart to default settings?
**Keywords:** reset chart, default settings, restore defaults

To reset the chart, you can either reload your original data or adjust the midpoint and zone sizes back to their default positions manually. There isn't a one-click reset, but reloading your project file will restore all saved settings.

## Can I share my analysis with colleagues?
**Keywords:** share, collaborate, team, export for sharing

Yes! You can share your analysis in several ways:

- **Export as PDF or Excel:** Share complete reports with all insights
- **Share project files:** Export as .seg file for colleagues to load and continue analysis
- **Export charts:** Share visual charts as PNG images
- **Export CSV:** Share the segmented data for further analysis

All exports are created on your device—you choose how and where to share them.

## What happens if I close my browser?
**Keywords:** browser close, lose data, session storage

Your data is automatically saved in your browser's temporary storage, so you can refresh the page without losing your work during a session. However, for long-term storage, use the Save button to download a .seg project file.

If you clear your browser cache or use a different browser, you'll need to load your saved .seg file to restore your work.
