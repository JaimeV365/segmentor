# Understanding the Model FAQ

## What is the Apostles Model?
**Keywords:** what is apostles model, apostles model explanation

The Apostles Model is a customer segmentation framework that classifies customers into four groups based on two dimensions: satisfaction and loyalty. It was developed by Thomas O. Jones and W. Earl Sasser Jr. in their 1995 Harvard Business Review article "Why Satisfied Customers Defect."

Segmentor.app is built on this proven framework—it's the Apostles Model revamped for modern times with updated terminology and enhanced analytics.

**The original model identified four customer types:**

- **Apostles** (now called Advocates): High satisfaction + High loyalty
- **Mercenaries:** High satisfaction + Low loyalty
- **Hostages:** Low satisfaction + High loyalty
- **Terrorists** (now called Trolls): Low satisfaction + Low loyalty

Segmentor.app brings this powerful framework into the 21st century with modern terminology, interactive visualisation, and advanced analytics.

## What do the quadrants mean?
**Keywords:** quadrants meaning, what do quadrants mean, advocates, trolls, mercenaries, hostages

The Apostles Model divides customers into four quadrants based on satisfaction and loyalty:

- **👑 Advocates (High Satisfaction, High Loyalty):** Your best customers who love your products and stick with you
- **⭐ Hostages (Low Satisfaction, High Loyalty):** They stick with you but there's room for improvement
- **⚠️ Mercenaries (High Satisfaction, Low Loyalty):** They're happy but might leave soon
- **🚨 Trolls (Low Satisfaction, Low Loyalty):** Neither satisfied nor loyal—potential negative word-of-mouth

## How do I interpret Advocates vs Trolls?
**Keywords:** advocates vs trolls, interpret results, understand segments

**Advocates** are your goldmine customers:

- Focus on retaining them and turning them into brand champions
- Ask for referrals and testimonials
- Consider them for beta testing new features

**Trolls** need immediate attention:

- Reach out personally to understand their concerns
- Address their issues quickly to prevent negative word-of-mouth
- Consider if they're worth retaining or if it's time to part ways

## How do I identify Near-Advocates?
**Keywords:** near advocates, identify near advocates, almost advocates

Near-Advocates are customers who are close to becoming full Advocates but need a small push. Look for:

- High satisfaction (4-5) but moderate loyalty (3-4)
- Customers who love your product but haven't fully committed
- Recent customers with high satisfaction scores

Enable the "Show Near-Advocates" option in the tool to highlight these customers. Focus on converting them to full Advocates through loyalty programmes, exclusive offers, or personalised engagement.

## What makes someone an Advocate?
**Keywords:** what makes apostle, apostle characteristics, high satisfaction high loyalty

An Advocate (Apostle in the original terminology) is a customer with both high satisfaction AND high loyalty—your best customers who genuinely love what you do.

**Characteristics of Advocates:**

- ✅ Highly satisfied with your product/service
- ✅ Actively recommend you to others
- ✅ Resist competitive offers
- ✅ Forgive occasional mistakes
- ✅ Provide valuable feedback
- ✅ Drive most of your organic growth

**In Segmentor.app:**
Advocates appear in the top-right corner of the visualisation grid. They score high on both axes: typically 8-10 on satisfaction and 9-10 on loyalty (on a 1-10 scale).

**The enhanced model also identifies Near-Advocates**—customers who are close to Advocate status and represent your best opportunity for conversion with targeted improvements.

**Why they matter:** Research shows that Advocates have significantly higher lifetime value, lower acquisition costs, and generate positive word-of-mouth that brings new customers at zero marketing cost.

**Your mission:** Protect your Advocates (keep doing what makes them happy) and create more Advocates by moving Near-Advocates up and to the right.

## Why does Segmentor.app use different terminology than the original model?
**Keywords:** terminology, modern language, apostles vs advocates

We use modern, inclusive language while maintaining the framework's integrity. The original 1995 model used terms that made sense then but feel outdated today.

**Original → Modern terminology:**

- **Apostles** → **Advocates:** More secular and professional
- **Terrorists** → **Trolls:** Removes violent connotations while keeping the meaning (destructive critics)
- Mercenaries & Hostages: Unchanged (still relevant metaphors)

**When we reference the original research:**
We use the original terminology (Apostles, Terrorists) to properly credit Jones and Sasser's work. The academic framework remains identical—only the labels have been modernised.

**Segmentor.app is "the Apostles Model on steroids"**—we've taken the proven framework and enhanced it with:

- Interactive real-time visualisation
- Advanced proximity analysis
- Historical tracking capabilities
- Modern data science techniques

Think of it as a respectful revision made from admiration, bringing a timeless framework into modern business practice.

## What's the difference between Loyalists and Advocates?
**Keywords:** loyalists vs advocates, difference, superfans

Loyalists are the full quadrant (top-right) of customers with both high satisfaction and high loyalty.

Advocates are the most loyal and satisfied customers within that quadrant—essentially 'Loyalists Plus.' They don't just stay—they actively promote you.

**Think of it like this:** All Advocates are Loyalists, but not all Loyalists are Advocates. Advocates are your superfans.
